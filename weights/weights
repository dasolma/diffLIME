CWRU_DPM_1.h5, The weights of the DPM model, trained with the source code from commit 0b50afb55cdfc9f23720efaf5b9f484793150534, were used. A dataset of 100,000 synthetic samples was generated using the top 5 most important frequencies, noise, and slope values derived from a CWRU dataset. All these signal properties, together with entropy and periodicity calculated from the synthetic signals, were used to condition the DPM. Additionally, the DPM was conditioned with the signal envelopes. Noise error (train, val): 0.13, 014, reconstruction error (train, val): 0.030, 0.030
